            "* **Feedback:**\n",
            "    * **Quantify Value:**  While Ankita mentions NBH's campaign experience, she could strengthen the pitch by quantifying the potential reach within Fern Hill and other societies (e.g., \"We have X number of users in Fern Hill, giving you access to a significant audience\").  Highlighting successful past campaigns with similar brands and their ROI would be beneficial.\n",
            "    * **Address Competition Implicitly:** While not directly mentioning competitors, Ankita could subtly emphasize NBH's unique strengths (e.g., \"Our platform allows for highly targeted advertising within the community,\" or \"We offer exclusive partnerships within these societies\").  This differentiates NBH without explicitly naming competitors.\n",
            "    * **Clarify Mysore Pricing Sooner:** While understandable that she doesn't have the information yet, setting a more concrete timeframe for Mysore pricing beyond \"Monday\" would manage expectations better.\n",

            "* **Chances of Deal Closure (Fern Hill Activation):** High (90%).  The logistics are being finalized, and both parties are actively engaged in coordinating the event.  The conversation suggests a strong likelihood of successful execution at Fern Hill.\n",
            "* **Chances of Deal Closure (Mysore & other locations):** Moderate (50%).  Ankita is exploring options and gathering information, but the deal closure depends on pricing, society availability, and the brand's overall marketing strategy.  Further discussions are needed. \n",

Emotional tone: Slightly apprehensive.\n",
            "*   **Rapport Building**: The conversation was professional but lacked strong rapport-building elements. Sanchit was direct and focused on his requirements, while Deepika primarily responded to his requests. There wasn't much proactive effort to build a personal connection.

            "*   **Improvement Areas**:\n",
            "    *   **Proactive Information Sharing**: NBH could be more proactive in sharing relevant information, even if it's a subset of their total universe, to build trust and demonstrate their capabilities.\n",
            "    *   **Value Proposition**: The pitch lacked a strong value proposition beyond simply offering BTL services. NBH could highlight unique advantages, such as better targeting within premium communities, superior execution quality, or competitive pricing, compared to MyGate and other options.\n",
            "    *   **Relationship Building**: Deepika could invest more time in understanding Sanchit's broader marketing goals and challenges, rather than just responding to immediate requests.\n",
            "    * **Addressing apprehension**: If Deepika is apprehensive to sharing the entire data, it should be communicated in such a way that it does not affect the chances of converting the lead.\n",

            "*   **Other Relevant Parameters**:\n",
            "    *   **Sense of Urgency**: Sanchit emphasized his desire to start immediately, with a launch date of the 24th (presumably of the current month). This creates a time constraint for NBH to deliver.\n",

            "### Lead Rating:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Possible Budget or Scope**: The scope is significant, potentially expanding to 25,000-30,000 societies across multiple cities. The budget is likely substantial, given the scale and the target audience (premium communities). Sanchit's current campaign with MyGate on 15,000 societies provides a good benchmark.\n",
            "*   **Chances of Closure (out of 100%)**: 40%.\n",
            "    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: Sanchit is interested but also cautious and comparative. He's already working with a competitor and is focused on getting the best value and reach.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning**: While NBH secured a pilot project, the hesitancy to share the full society list and the lack of a clearly articulated competitive advantage lower the chances. The success of the pilot in Balewadi and Powai will be crucial in determining whether NBH can secure a larger portion of the campaign. The fact that Sanchit is already working with a competitor and is actively comparing options reduces the likelihood of a complete switch to NBH.\n",

            "    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: The discussion around competition was direct and assertive. Sanchit is clearly evaluating NBH against his existing vendor (MyGate) and potentially others. He is price-conscious and focused on reach and execution quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Action Items**:\n",
            "    *   Deepika to share a list of premium (A and B category) societies in Balewadi (Pune) and Powai (Mumbai) for a pilot project.\n",
            "    *   Deepika to share the commercials/pricing for the proposed BTL activities.\n",
            "    *   Deepika to extract premium areas from the cities mentioned by Sanchit in a previous email and share the society list.\n",
            "    *   Sanchit to review the list and provide feedback to NBH by the next day (to start the pilot).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Sales Pitch Analysis and Rating on Key Parameters:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Rebuttal Handling**: Deepika was somewhat hesitant to share the entire society list, citing that it was \"not all possible to share.\" While she offered alternatives (sharing areas based on interest or focusing on premium segments), this could be perceived as less transparent than a competitor like MyGate, which Sanchit had already worked with to shortlist societies. Emotional tone: Slightly apprehensive.\n",
            "*   **Rapport Building**: The conversation was professional but lacked strong rapport-building elements. Sanchit was direct and focused on his requirements, while Deepika primarily responded to his requests. There wasn't much proactive effort to build a personal connection. There's a mild conflict regarding the sharing of the society list.\n",
            "*   **Improvement Areas**:\n",
            "    *   **Proactive Information Sharing**: NBH could be more proactive in sharing relevant information, even if it's a subset of their total universe, to build trust and demonstrate their capabilities.\n",
            "    *   **Value Proposition**: The pitch lacked a strong value proposition beyond simply offering BTL services. NBH could highlight unique advantages, such as better targeting within premium communities, superior execution quality, or competitive pricing, compared to MyGate and other options.\n",
            "    *   **Relationship Building**: Deepika could invest more time in understanding Sanchit's broader marketing goals and challenges, rather than just responding to immediate requests.\n",
            "    * **Addressing apprehension**: If Deepika is apprehensive to sharing the entire data, it should be communicated in such a way that it does not affect the chances of converting the lead.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Other Relevant Parameters**:\n",
            "    *   **Sense of Urgency**: Sanchit emphasized his desire to start immediately, with a launch date of the 24th (presumably of the current month). This creates a time constraint for NBH to deliver.\n",
            "    * **Data-Driven Approach:** Sanchit wants data.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Lead Rating:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Possible Budget or Scope**: The scope is significant, potentially expanding to 25,000-30,000 societies across multiple cities. The budget is likely substantial, given the scale and the target audience (premium communities). Sanchit's current campaign with MyGate on 15,000 societies provides a good benchmark.\n",
            "*   **Chances of Closure (out of 100%)**: 40%.\n",
            "    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: Sanchit is interested but also cautious and comparative. He's already working with a competitor and is focused on getting the best value and reach.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning**: While NBH secured a pilot project, the hesitancy to share the full society list and the lack of a clearly articulated competitive advantage lower the chances. The success of the pilot in Balewadi and Powai will be crucial in determining whether NBH can secure a larger portion of the campaign. The fact that Sanchit is already working with a competitor and is actively comparing options reduces the likelihood of a complete switch to NBH.\n",

NBH could highlight unique advantages, such as better targeting within premium communities, superior execution quality, or competitive pricing, compared to MyGate and other options.\\n    *   **Relationship Building**: Deepika could invest more time in understanding Sanchit's broader marketing goals and challenges, rather than just responding to immediate requests.\\n    * **Addressing apprehension**: If Deepika is apprehensive to sharing the entire data, it should be communicated in such a way that it does not affect the chances of converting the lead.\\n\\n*   **Other Relevant Parameters**:\\n    *   **Sense of Urgency**: Sanchit emphasized his desire to start immediately, with a launch date of the 24th (presumably of the current month). This creates a time constraint for NBH to deliver.\\n    * **Data-Driven Approach:** Sanchit wants data.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Lead Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"*   **Possible Budget or Scope**: The scope is significant, potentially expanding to 25,000-30,000 societies across multiple cities.

Sanchit's current campaign with MyGate on 15,000 societies provides a good benchmark.\\n*   **Chances of Closure (out of 100%)**: 40%.\\n    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: Sanchit is interested but also cautious and comparative. He's already working with a competitor and is focused on getting the best value and reach.\\n    *   **Reasoning**: While NBH secured a pilot project, the hesitancy to share the full society list and the lack of a clearly articulated competitive advantage lower the chances. The success of the pilot in Balewadi and Powai will be crucial in determining whether NBH can secure a larger portion of the campaign. The fact that Sanchit is already working with a competitor and is actively comparing options reduces the likelihood of a complete switch to NBH.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "*   **Meeting Duration**: Approximately 6 minutes 44 seconds (from 01:58 to 08:42).\n",

            "    *   **Deepika Akhand**: NBH Sales Team member.\n",
            "    *   **Sanchit Yadav**: Brand representative (likely a marketing/brand manager). Notable interaction: Sanchit drives the conversation, specifying requirements and existing engagements. Deepika is reactive, trying to accommodate requests.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Key Discussion Points**:\n",
            "    *   Sanchit is looking to expand his brand's BTL advertising reach, focusing on premium gated communities.\n",
            "    *   He is already working with MyGate and wants to compare NBH's offerings and pricing.\n",
            "    *   He emphasizes the need for targeted advertising (Forex brand) in affluent areas (A and B category societies).\n",
            "    *   He requests a pilot project in Balewadi (Pune) and Powai (Mumbai) to assess NBH's execution quality.\n",
            "    *   There is a reluctance from Deepika to share the complete list of societies upfront.\n",
            "    *   Sanchit prefers to have his internal team shortlist societies based on their local knowledge.\n",
            "    * Launch of a new marketing campaign is iminent, planned to 24th of the same month.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Key Questions Asked by the Brand**:\n",
            "    *   \"I just wanted to understand numbers because this is little mesh.\" (Requesting a more granular breakdown of NBH's universe).\n",
            "    *   \"If I may know, I mean, what all BTL activities you might be [doing].\" (Wants clarity on the type of activities).\n",
            "    *   \"And when it comes to lips, what is the date you're looking forward to?\"(Asking for the date, likely a typo, meant to ask \"rate\")\n",
            "    *\t\"Right now we are doing 15,000. Sorry, 15,000 left with my gate.\"(Clarifying current scale with competitor)\n",
            "    * \"Apart from Pune, which all cities, you know, all.\"(Clarifying current requirements)\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Marketing Assets Pitched**:\n",
            "    *   Door Tags.\n",
            "    *   Lift Advertisements.\n",
            "    *   (Gate branding was inquired about but rejected by the brand).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Discussion Around Competition**:\n",
            "    *   **MyGate (MG)**: Explicitly mentioned multiple times. Sanchit reveals he's already working with MyGate on 15,000 societies and wants to expand to 25,000-30,000. This sets a clear benchmark for NBH.\n",
            "    *   **Other Platforms (Indirect)**: While Meta/Google weren't directly mentioned, the focus on targeted, niche advertising implies competition with digital platforms that offer demographic targeting. Sanchit's preference for BTL (\"very captive or very personalized things\") suggests he's looking for an alternative or complement to digital. The mention of \"two more vendors\" besides MyGate and NBH indicates awareness of other BTL players (potentially Adonmo or similar).\n",
            "    *   **Sentiment**: The discussion is highly competitive. Sanchit is comparing NBH directly to MyGate and is price-conscious (\"Share the commercials as well, whatever you have. Because I want to match it with the ones that I'm doing currently\"). He's in a strong negotiating position.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Action Items**:\n",
            "    *   Deepika to provide a list of premium (A and B category) societies in Balewadi (Pune) and Powai (Mumbai) immediately.\n",
            "    *   Deepika to share pricing for door tags and lift advertisements.\n",
            "    *\tDeepika to also prepare premium society lists for other cities mentioned in a previous email.\n",
            "    *   Sanchit to review the list and potentially approve a pilot project with NBH.\n",
            "    *\tSanchit to share feedback with his team.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Sales Pitch Analysis and Rating on Key Parameters:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Rebuttal Handling**: Weak. Deepika was hesitant to share the full society list, which is a reasonable request from the client's perspective, especially given their existing relationship with a competitor. Her response (\"Because the entire list, the entire universe is, I mean, not all possible to share\") was not persuasive and didn't address the client's need for targeted information. Emotional Tone: Slightly defensive and inflexible.\n",
            "*   **Rapport Building**: Limited. The conversation was primarily transactional. Sanchit was direct and focused on his requirements, while Deepika was mostly reactive. There wasn't significant effort to build a strong relationship or understand the brand's deeper needs beyond the immediate ask.\n",
            "*   **Improvement Areas**:\n",
            "    *   **Proactive Information Sharing**: NBH should be prepared to share targeted society lists based on client-specified criteria (location, category). This demonstrates transparency and willingness to collaborate.\n",
            "    *   **Value Proposition**: Deepika didn't clearly articulate NBH's unique value proposition compared to MyGate. What makes NBH better, different, or more suitable for this particular brand?\n",
            "    *   **Relationship Building**: Deepika should have asked more probing questions to understand the brand's overall marketing strategy and goals, not just the immediate BTL campaign.\n",
            "    *   **Solution-Oriented Approach**: Instead of just saying \"no\" to sharing the full list, Deepika could have offered alternative solutions, like a detailed presentation showcasing NBH's capabilities in the target areas.\n",
            "*   **Other Relevant Parameters**:\n",
            "    *\tDeepika did adapt and agree to prepare a limited listing.\n",
            "    *   **Client's Urgency**: Sanchit emphasizes the need for speed (\"immediately\") due to an upcoming launch. This urgency should be acknowledged and addressed proactively.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Lead Rating:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Possible Budget or Scope**: The scope is potentially large (expanding from 15,000 to 25,000-30,000 societies). The budget is likely significant, given the premium target audience and the existing spend with MyGate. However, NBH is starting with a small pilot, so the initial budget will be limited.\n",
            "*   **Chances of Closure (out of 100%)**: 40%. While Sanchit is actively looking for additional vendors, he's already heavily invested in MyGate. NBH's chances depend on:\n",
            "    *   The quality of the society list provided.\n",
            "    *   Competitive pricing.\n",
            "    *   Demonstrating superior execution quality during the pilot.\n",
            "    *   Building a stronger relationship and offering a compelling value proposition.\n",
            "\n",
            "    The sentiment analysis indicates that the brand is open to exploring options but is also cautious and price-sensitive. They are actively comparing NBH to their existing vendor (MyGate).\n",
            "    The chances of closing the deal are moderate.\n",
